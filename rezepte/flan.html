     <br>

    <img src="../images/flan-index-655684df35cda.avif" height="400" width="600" alt="flan">


    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Complex in appearance, however simple to bake. Glossy circular dessert</p>


    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <h4>For the caramel sauce</h4>
    
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons water</li>
        <li>1/2 cup granulated sugar</li>
    </ul>

    <br>

    <h4>For the custard</h4>
    
    <ul>
        <li>4 large egg yolks, plus 1 whole large egg</li>
        <li>1 (14-ounce) can sweetened condensed milk</li>
        <li>2 cups heavy cream</li>  
        <li>1 tablespoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon kosher salt</li>


    
    </ul>

    <h3>How to bake glossy caramel round</h3>


     <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 300°F. Set the rack in the center of the oven. Bring about 40 ounces (5 cups) of water to a boil for the water bath that you’ll use to bake the flan.</li>
        <li> <p>Make the caramel sauce: </p>
            <p>Add 2 tablespoons water and the sugar in a small saucepan. Swirl it just a bit until all the sugar looks wet. Set it over medium heat, and cook without stirring until the mixture bubbles vigorously and turns from pale to light brown, then amber to dark amber. It should look glossy and smooth, not grainy. This takes 4 to 6 minutes, depending on the strength of your stove.</p>
            <p>If crystals start to form in the caramel, it's best to start over. There's no way to fix this.</p>
            <p>In the meantime, have an 8x2-inch round cake pan and a kitchen towel ready. </p> </li>
        <li>Carefully pour the caramel into the cake pan and working quickly tilt the pan to swirl and coat the bottom and sides. Hold on to the sides with a kitchen towel—there is nothing more painful than molten sugar. Set the pan aside.</li>
        <li>
            <p>Make the custard: </p>
In a 4-cup measuring cup or medium bowl, whisk the egg yolks, whole egg, and sweetened condensed milk until fully combined. Whisk in the heavy cream, vanilla, and salt. The custard should be smooth and thoroughly combined, but try not to whisk it vigorously, creating too many bubbles.
</li>
        <li>
            <p>Prepare the water bath: </p>
            <p>Pour the custard through a  fine mesh strainer over the caramel in the pan. Place the pan into an oven-safe vessel large enough to hold it—a roasting pan, baking dish, or shallow braiser with straight sides, and place it in the oven. </p>
            <p>Pour the boiling water into the roasting dish until it comes about halfway up the sides of the cake pan.</p> </li>
        <li><p>Bake the flan:</p>
            <p>Bake the flan until the top is set and no longer wet, but a little jiggly when you gently nudge the cake pan, about 1 hour 20 minutes..</p> 
       </li>

       <li>
        <p>Chill the flan:</p> 
        <p>Carefully remove the cake pan from the water bath (use a kitchen towel) and let it cool for about 1 hour on the kitchen counter. Tightly cover the pan with plastic wrap, making sure it doesn’t touch the top of the flan. Chill in the fridge for at least 6 hours or overnight.</p>
      </li>

    <li>
        <p>Serve the flan:</p>
        <p>When ready to serve (flan should be served cold), run a small knife around the edges to loosen the flan. Flip a large, deep plate upside down on top of the cake pan. In one swift movement, invert the cake pan and plate. Give the bottom of the cake pan a couple of firm taps to help release the flan onto the plate. </p>
       <p>Gently lift the cake pan and marvel at your work of art. It’s okay if some caramel is still stuck to the cake pan. Soak it in water for a few minutes, and it’ll melt off.</p>
    </li>

    </ol>
